# rsvp
A simple web app for event attendees to RSVP to an invite, update their information, and find details about the event. This is my project for Code Louisville Full Stack JS. 

With this app, the event host and owner of the app can submit a list of attendees with minimal details. After editing a few settings and creating the attendee list, this information gets inputted into the event's website and the event host is able to share this website with their potential attendees via invites (physical or digital). The potential attendees can then RSVP to their invite via the website. This will allow the host to collect pertenant information regarding who plans on attending their event.

###Plan of Action:
* [ ] Organize site map
* [ ] Research bootstrap 4-alpha as HTML/CSS frameworks
* [ ] Map out functionality of rsvp app
* [ ] Design site, example: Billy & Raven's wedding
* [ ] Build web app
* [ ] Test

###Required functionality:
* Dashboard for host that allows:
  * Input of guest list
  * Review guests that have RSVP'd
  * List of guests still needing to RSVP
  * Receive comments from guests
* Input field for guests that requires:
  * First + Last name
  * Address
  * Email address
  * Phone number
  * Number of guests
  * Comments

###Optional functionality:
* Pull in Facebook friends list for populating guest list
* Input new Guests that the attendee wishes to bring. This will initiate an invite email to the Guests' guest, for them to RSVP as well.
